<h1>Windows Parent Publishes Their First Windows 8 App in Celebration of Their Third Year Anniversary</h1>
<p><em>London, UK. (November 18, 2014)</em> - In celebration of their third year anniversary Windows Parent launches their first Windows 8 app - App Discovery by Windows Parent. This latest addition to the Windows Parent platform was published with the purpose of helping parents discover family-friendly apps among the 175,000 apps currently available in the Windows Apps Store. The app contains Windows Parent curated catalog which until now was only available on Windows Phone and online. With over 6,000 followers via social media channels such Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest, Windows Parent recommendations are followed by more and more families every day, helping English speaker app developers connect with families in English-speaking markets as well as 19 Spanish-speaking markets via its sister Spanish platform Familia Windows.<br /><br />

Windows Parent's founder, Sandra Gonzalez, mother of two and a self-declared Windows evangelist, shared her thoughts on this milestone "The launch of App Discovery by Windows Parent to the Windows Store it's a great milestone for Windows Parent. The app is in its infancy, as it is the off-sprint of a hackaton hosted by Microsoft in London. However, I have great plans for it, including bringing all the categorization currently available in our website and also the localization of the app in at least three other languages"<br /><br />

Windows Parent also announces the launch of <a href="http://bit.ly/RF_Pinterest"><span style="color:purple">Rodzinny Windows</span></a>, their app discovery platform in Polish, which is currently hosted on Pinterest. They are also in the process of expanding to French and Italian speaking markets.<br /><br />
